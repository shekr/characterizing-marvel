It was on one such extortion racket that he was convicted of aggravated assault and remanded to prison. [[Loki]], the Asgardian god of mischief, knew Creel would be the perfect unwitting agent to battle [[Thor (Thor Odinson)|Thor]], so he slipped an enchanted potion into Creel's drinking water in the prison commissary. Filled with power, Creel broke out of prison and soon found himself in conflict with Thor. He found he could absorb the properties of Thor's hammer as well as Thor himself, and Creel, calling himself the Absorbing Man, managed to force Thor to flee. In fact, Thor was told that his love, [[Foster-Kincaid, Jane|Jane Foster]], had been kidnapped by Loki, and he left to rescue her. A braggart and lout to the end, Creel flaunted his \"success\" until Thor returned after making sure Jane Foster was safe. A violent battle ensued, but Thor managed to use his hammer's magic to alter the elements Creel had transformed into. Suddenly forced into the qualities of helium, the Absorbing Man drifted apart.",

Unaware of her true mutant nature, the deeply religious Beaubier believed that her flying was a divine miracle. The School’s headmistress, Soeur Anne, considered it blasphemy and had Beaubier severely disciplined. The resulting corporal punishment triggered a dissociative identity disorder in Beaubier, and a second, extroverted persona emerged. Beaubier secretly left the school that night, returning three days later with no memory of where she had been or what she had done. Subsequent discipline forced Beaubier to repress her second personality, and eventually she became a teacher at the school.

Each couple had one child after the Pride's creation, all six of whom were designated to take their parents' places in the Gibborim's new paradise. While Gertrude was a sophomore in high school, she and the other Pride children learned of their parents' secret lives. Exploring the Yorkes' home, Gertrude discovered a gift for her from her parents: a genetically-created female Deinonychus-like dinosaur from the 87th century. She dubbed the creature Old Lace and took on the code name Arsenic for herself, preferring it to her given name. The two joined the other children in trying to expose the Pride's crimes. On the run, the six kids and Old Lace made their home in the Hostel, an abandoned underground mansion. The group, dubbed the [[Runaways]], encountered various threats, including the vampire [[Topher]] and corrupt members of the LAPD, while evading the Pride. In the meantime, Gertrude struck up a romance with team mate [[Talkback]] (Chase Stein.) A final confrontation with the Gibborim and the teens' parents ended with the apparent deaths of the Pride, as well as turncoat Runaway [[Wilder, Alex|Alex Wilder]]. The group was then taken into custody by the state, which separated them and took Old Lace away. They soon regrouped and retrieved the dinosaur before temporarily going back into hiding.","intro_year":2003,"character_id":1010882,"nationality":"U.S., U.S.A","name":"Old Lace","appearances":10,"gender":"Female"},{"image":"http://i.annihil.us/u/prod/marvel/i/mg/b/40/image_not_available.jpg","bio_desc":"Burt Garthwaite, construction worker and abusive father and husband, left his family when his son Dirk was at an early age (although his mother believed him to have later died and led her son to believe so as well).

At that year's International Conference on Genetics in Geneva, Switzerland, a mysterious stranger (actually the [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] [[Phaeder]], father of [[Maelstrom]]) handed Herbert papers containing a blueprint for breaking the genetic code.

Returning to his mother's basement, he finally succeeded, evolving his Dalmatian Dempsey to humanoid form, but Dempsey was shot by hunters.

Somewhat shy and reserved, Ryan has proved to be a good student, except for Chemistry, which she dislikes. Preferring open countryside to big cities, it seems Ryan prefers to sunbathe and surf rather than be caught up in the ongoing human/mutant situation.

To his dismay, his hand began to turn to stone-like material still capable of movement. Accidentally touching his other hand, he found that he could transform his entire body into the stone-like material. He also discovered that any matter he touched also turned to stone.

Though both of Nekra's parents were African-American, she was born with chalk-white skin. Despised by her family, she ran away from home at the age of ten and met Jerome Beechman, the son of another person exposed to radiation in the accident. Shunning other people, the two lived together in the desert for the next six years, surviving by their wits and educating themselves with stolen books. When an angry mob attacked them one evening, the two manifested their mutant abilities for the first time, killing some of their attackers and driving off the rest.","intro_year":1973,"character_id":1011422,"nationality":"","name":"Nekra","appearances":0,"gender":"Female"},{"image":"http://i.annihil.us/u/prod/marvel/i/mg/b/40/image_not_available.jpg","bio_desc":"","intro_year":1943,"character_id":1011424,"nationality":"","name":"Miss America","appearances":41,"gender":"Female"},{"image":"http://i.annihil.us/u/prod/marvel/i/mg/f/90/511155f5015e0.jpg","bio_desc":"","intro_year":2008,"character_id":1011428,"nationality":"American","name":"Hope Summers","appearances":62,"gender":"Female"},{"image":"http://i.annihil.us/u/prod/marvel/i/mg/b/40/image_not_available.jpg","bio_desc":"","intro_year":2003,"character_id":1011766,"nationality":"Inapplicable","name":"Azazel (Mutant)","appearances":2,"gender":"Male"},{"image":"http://i.annihil.us/u/prod/marvel/i/mg/b/f0/4ce59e13db02c.jpg","bio_desc":"('',)","intro_year":"Unknown","character_id":1014812,"nationality":"Unknown","name":"Thunderbolt Ross","appearances":1,"gender":"Male"},{"image":"http://i.annihil.us/u/prod/marvel/i/mg/6/10/4cd053529dd41.jpg","bio_desc":"('',)","intro_year":"Unknown","character_id":1014976,"nationality":"Unknown","name":"Lady Vermin","appearances":0,"gender":"Female"},{"image":"http://i.annihil.us/u/prod/marvel/i/mg/c/40/4cd053ea971ed.jpg","bio_desc":"('',)","intro_year":"Unknown","character_id":1014977,"nationality":"Unknown","name":"Lady Ursula","appearances":0,"gender":"Female"},{"image":"http://i.annihil.us/u/prod/marvel/i/mg/1/b0/4cd05ab2bd5ee.jpg","bio_desc":"('',)","intro_year":"Unknown","character_id":1014980,"nationality":"Unknown","name":"Lord Tyger","appearances":0,"gender":"Male"},{"image":"http://i.annihil.us/u/prod/marvel/i/mg/6/70/4cd061e6d6573.jpg","bio_desc":"('',)","intro_year":"Unknown","character_id":1014990,"nationality":"Unknown","name":"Alice","appearances":0,"gender":"Female"},{"image":"http://i.annihil.us/u/prod/marvel/i/mg/b/40/image_not_available.jpg","bio_desc":"('',)","intro_year":"Unknown","character_id":1015007,"nationality":"Unknown","name":"Dreaming Celestial","appearances":3,"gender":"Male"},{"image":"http://i.annihil.us/u/prod/marvel/i/mg/9/20/4cdd81a5743a4.jpg","bio_desc":"('',)","intro_year":"Unknown","character_id":1015035,"nationality":"Unknown","name":"Shen","appearances":0,"gender":"Female"}]
